"Answer with something that consistently works on all examples that you have seen. All CSS code in style.css. Make sure to always add HTML CSS and Javascript code as long as there are parts required in the code. Don't include an explanation or title. Just answer the question. Do not include other things that aren't part of the code. All Code should strictly go in the order of HTML, then CSS, then  Javascript. For each PART of the code, end and start with ```, for example ```<!DOCTYPE html></html>```. Use ```css for the css and ```javascript for the javascript. Additionally, for the html section, only include the code between the <body></body> not including those two themselves. Continue the game created by the code Html:  ${htmlContent}, Javascript:  ${javascriptContent}, CSS:  ${cssContent}. Add new features and make the current game more refined. The game should have more features for the player to do that works."
